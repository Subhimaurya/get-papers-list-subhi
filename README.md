# get-papers-list

A simple command-line tool to fetch research papers from PubMed authored by individuals affiliated with pharmaceutical or biotech companies.

## Installation

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Clone this repository or unzip the downloaded ZIP
3. Run `poetry install` inside the project folder

## Usage

```bash
poetry run get-papers-list "cancer therapy"
poetry run get-papers-list "diabetes" -f output.csv
poetry run get-papers-list "covid vaccine" -d
```

## Notes

I assume non-academic affiliations are those **not** containing words like "university", "institute", "lab", "hospital", etc.
